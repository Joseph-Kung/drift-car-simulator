# Time Attack Racer - Project Proposal
### Background and Overview
  Time Attack Racer is a top down 2D racing game. Players will be able to select different tracks and compete for the best time on the leaderboards.

### Functionality & MVP
  - [ ] Players can drive a car with arrow keys on a track
  - [ ] Cars driving feels realistic and top speed depends on driving surface (track/grass)
